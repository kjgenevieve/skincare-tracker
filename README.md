# Dermary
A skincare tracker that enables users to find correlations between skin health and their products.

## Motivation
As an acne-prone logic enthusiast, I was able to cure the majority of my skin problems through a spreadsheet. </br>

As the data grew, however, the spreadsheet became more cumbersome. I wanted to simplify the process of tracking what goes onto face by creating an app.

## Screenshots/Demo
